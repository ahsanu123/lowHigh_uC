initial project, 
make electronic design for Simple high voltage AC controller with SSR and avr (ATMega16). use [Mighty Core](https://github.com/MCUdude/MightyCore).   
**GOAL**
  1. device can control delivered power of AC voltage, controlled by AVR ATMega16
  2. add simple tft/oled display to device
  3. add input to uC
  4. add USB-Serial to device, 
  5. if posible, manufacture design with PCB factory service
  6. and so on...
